# Faire-Direct-Analytics-Case


**What is Faire Direct?*** Faire Direct (formally known as Elevate) is the main retailer (demand) acquisition strategy for Faire. It is a viral loop that works as follows:1. Faire incentivizes makers to invite their existing customers (retailers) to Faire:* The maker gets 0% commission on all orders from that retailer forever* The retailer gets $100 off their first order and free shipping for a year* The retailer gets free returns on their first order and Net 60 credit terms2. Makers can send an email via Faire (or share their private link directly) to their existing accounts (retailers who have already ordered from them) and leads (retailers who have never ordered from them)3. If retailers open the email and click through, they reach the maker's page on Faire and are prompted to sign up for Faire4. Faire acquires a new retailer once that retailer has signed up and placed their first confirmed order. Faire can then market other makers (non-competitive with the referring one) to that retailer and any order from the retailer to a non-referring maker generates commission.
 
**Prompt*** The base metric of the Faire Direct viral loop above is the number of new retailers that place their first confirmed order in any given week.In recent weeks, this number has gone down. The task of this project is to investigate the cause of this decline


**Memo will answer the following questions:*** What are some of the hypotheses about the underlying cause of this decline?* What are some product ideas that could be implemented to bring this number back up?
